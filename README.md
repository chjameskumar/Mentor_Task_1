Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/balance+scale
Load this data into your code by making use of Pandas Module.
Explore this data set by applying relevant functions from pandas on it. A few example exploration
tasks are given below:
Check the number of data points and features in the data.
Find unique values for each column.
Check the data types of values in each column.
Check basic statistics of data.
Add a new column in the data.
Then drop this column just created.
create a new column that has values found as a result of applying some operation on the
existing columns
Access elements using loc and iloc.
Check if there are missing values. If yes, which column.



Assignment 2

Write a function compute_dist() that accepts a list of values as input and outputs a dictionary
storing the distribution of the data represented by the list. Here, distribution means tracking how
many times each element is appearing in the given list.
